//! Recording State Machine - Single source of truth for valid state transitions
//!
//! State diagram:
//! ```text
//! Ready ──Start──> Recording ──Stop──> Transcribing ──reset()──> Ready
//!   │                   │
//! [Retry]            [Lock]
//!   │                   ↓
//!   │          RecordingLocked
//!   │                   │
//!   │               [Start]──> Transcribing (Fn pressed again to stop)
//!   │               [Cancel]──> Ready
//!   └──────────────────────────> Transcribing
//! ```
//!
//! Note: Transcribing state exits via reset() - no dedicated events needed
//! since both success and failure return to Ready state.
